"A battle ensued between you and the witch, and after a long and grueling fight, you emerged victorious.",

"The unicorn used the flower to restore its powers and thanked you by granting you three wishes.",
"And so, you lived happily ever after with your three wishes and the knowledge that you had helped a magical creature in need."
